# Authentication with Google API Client Library for .NET
This is just an example of how to authenicate a service account with a JSON key with the .NET Client API Library.

For example, if you are trying to access the Google Compute Engine API to restart an instance.

This is based on .NET Core 1.1 (Or standard 1.3?? wtf is it MS) which varies from most of the .NET examples because the `GoogleWebAuthorizationBroker` class that most examples show you are not available to it.

If this helps one other person not spend four hours trying to figure this out it will have made my day.
